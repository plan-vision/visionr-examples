This document outlines the scripting capabilities for interacting with VisionR's database-like objects. The navigation paths described herein follow the property relation paths defined in the system's schema. It is assumed the developer has access or is otherwise aware of the structure of the schema. 

1. Dynamic Object Navigation and Querying
 • Objects (e.g., `db.infradash.server`, `db.infra.rack`) are navigable via dot notation.
 • Methods like `SELECT()` or `META()` retrieve records or property metadata.
 • This enables on–the–fly extraction of attributes (names, codes, data types) from object "tables."

2. Iteration and Debugging
 • `forEach` loops traverse collections (e.g., properties within a rack) for logging.
 • Console logging inspects object schemas, revealing stored names, codes, and verifying value types.

3. Metadata Access
 • `META` method returns a rich object describing a property, including:
  – “code” (key/identifier),
  – “valueTable” (data table, if applicable), and
  – data type (e.g., text, string) with additional flags.

Overall, the JS layer level scription for VisionR schema and UI provides quite a flexible framework for interacting with dynamic DB objects, enabling querying, iteration, metadata retrieval, and property inspection. These are not some super-fancy observables, yet expose the complete data layer on a on-demand basis. Caution is advised regarding undefined hierarchy parts or unavailable methods.

### Interacting with Data Definition and UI

Scripting capabilities extend to interacting with data definitions, presentation properties, and forms.

*   **Internationalized Data**: Scripts can access internationalized properties. For example, to retrieve a localized string for a property, scripts can use `db.object.property.i18n[session.runtime.locale]` or similar context-aware methods.
*   **Presentation Control**: Scripts can read presentation properties like `highlighting` (e.g., `object.highlighting.path`) to understand UI visual cues. The logic of `displayString` can also be leveraged by scripts for custom display formatting.
*   **Forms Context**: When scripts execute within a form, they can access the current object via `details.object`. Scripts can also interact with form components and trigger actions, for instance, by calling `id.execute()` on a script defined with `<script #id>`. This allows for dynamic behavior within the UI.

### Database Query Examples:

Here are examples demonstrating how to query database objects:

*   **Counting Records**:
    *   `db.infra.colocation.COUNT()`: Returns the total count of colocation records.
    *   `db.infra.colocation.VSQL("COUNT(racks)")`: Uses VSQL to count racks associated with colocation records.

*   **Filtering and Selecting**:
    *   `db.infra.rack.COUNT("id IN (SELECT racks FROM infra.colocation)")`: Counts rack records linked to colocation entries.
    *   `db.infra.rack.VSQL({select: 'code', where: ' id IN (SELECT racks.id FROM infra.colocation)' })`: Selects `code` for racks linked to colocation entries.

*   **Accessing Specific Instances**:
    *   `db.core.user_role.INSTANCES["administrators"]`: Accesses a specific `user_role` instance by its code.
    *   `db.core.user.byId(1)`: Retrieves a `user` object by its numerical ID.

*   **Schema and Metadata Queries**:
    *   `db.core.objectdef.selectWhere("module.code='core' AND code='attribute_type'")`: Queries schema definitions based on conditions.
    *   `db.core.lang.SELECT("is_active=1")`: Selects active language objects.
    *   `db.documents.document.SELECT()`: Retrieves all document records.
    *   `db.documents.folder.SELECT()`: Retrieves all folder records.
    *   `db.core.property.selectWhere("objectdef="+od.id)`: Queries properties for a given object definition ID.

*   **Object Instantiation**:
    *   `new db.infra.rack()`: Creates a new instance of a `rack` object.
    *   `new db.infra.OBJECTDEFS['server']()`: Dynamically creates a new `server` object instance.

*   **Accessing Schema from Object Instances**:

    *   Object instances expose a `SCHEMA` property that allows runtime introspection of their definition. For example, `v.SCHEMA.properties` on an instance `v` will return a comma-separated string of all properties defined for that objectdef. This is useful for understanding the objectdef's structure and available attributes dynamically.

    Example:
    ```
    var x = db.infra.server.SELECT()
    var v = x[0]
    v.SCHEMA.properties
    // Expected output: ID,Object definition,Code,Server,Sort ID,Rack,Model,Serial Number,CPU Cores,CPU Speed,Memory,Storage,Status,Last Updated,Physical Admin,Vendor,services,incidents,Description,Insert time,Update time,Insert by,Update by,Access owner,Access read,Access update,Access delete,Access copy,Unique Identifier
    ```
